# CovidApp
FBLA Covid App project

The idea of this project is to create a mobile application that uses the Google Places API to find out information about a certain destination.
The app would work like this:
1) In app, search up location/target destination (uses Google Maps embed)
2) Outputs information using Google places about location, brief summary of location, and google data on density in that location at certain times during the day (upon going to that place, users use a google maps embed to go to google maps and get directions)
4) Using this data, people can plan simple trips, like to the Grocery store, with this app to find out the safest time to go
5) Other features that may be implemented are: Local Area lock-down/security code, local area news, and related health and safety rules and numbers
